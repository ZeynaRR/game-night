To make this work you will have to download Node Js (it is necessary because it's the server used to make react native work). 
You can use this tutorial https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_environment_setup.htm to install Node js.

I used this really cool tutorial to start the project, you can read it too to understand how it works : https://code.likeagirl.io/creating-tinder-like-swipe-component-with-react-native-3bf15e6be7e3.

You should download Expo https://expo.dev/tools#cli and have it on your phone if you want to test the app directly there.

You will also have to install some libraries using the command npm install nameOfTheLibrary.

Do not hesitate if you have any questions about how to install something or if you encounter errors !
